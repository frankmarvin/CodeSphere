🌐 CodeSphere
I'm Frank Marvin — welcome to CodeSphere, a modern, real-time collaborative code editor and browser-based development environment.
CodeSphere delivers a seamless coding experience directly in the browser, allowing multiple developers to write, edit, and test code simultaneously. Powered by WebSockets and a modular full-stack architecture, the platform provides instant synchronization and live project execution — with zero installation required.
